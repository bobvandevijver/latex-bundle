### Step 1: check existing issues

Go to [our issues page][docs-issues] and search existing issues, your problem may have been answered there already.

### Step 3: create new issue

To create a new issue go to [Github issues][docs-issues] and click on **New issue** button (or use [this shortcut][docs-new-issue]).

### Basic formatting guide

While writing your issue please use Github Flavored Markdown to make it more readable.

If you paste any code **wrap it in github's code block!** To do that start with 3 **```** characters, then name language you're useing, for example **yaml**:

> **```**yaml

> my.yaml_code:  is here

> **```**

will resuilt in:
```yaml
my.yaml_code:  is here
```

To learn how to use GFM simply click on *Github Flavored Markdown* link above issue form to see!
